You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.\r\n\r\nYou can use Markdown most places around GitHub:\r\n\r\n    Gists\r\n    Comments in Issues and Pull Requests\r\n    Files with the .md or .markdown extension\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n    Text Lists Images Headers & Quotes Code Extras \r\n\r\nIt's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)\r\n\r\nIt's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even link to Google!\r\n\r\nSyntax guide\r\n\r\nHere’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.\r\nHeaders\r\n\r\n# This is an <h1> tag\r\n## This is an <h2> tag\r\n###### This is an <h6> tag\r\n\r\nEmphasis\r\n\r\n*This text will be italic*\r\n_This will also be italic_\r\n\r\n**This text will be bold**\r\n__This will also be bold__\r\n\r\n_You **can** combine them_\r\n\r\nLists\r\nUnordered\r\n\r\n* Item 1\r\n* Item 2\r\n  * Item 2a\r\n  * Item 2b\r\n\r\nOrdered\r\n\r\n1. Item 1\r\n2. Item 2\r\n3. Item 3\r\n   * Item 3a\r\n   * Item 3b\r\n\r\nImages\r\n\r\n![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)\r\nFormat: ![Alt Text](url)\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nhttp://github.com - automatic!\r\n[GitHub](http://github.com)\r\n\r\nBlockquotes\r\n\r\nAs Kanye West said:\r\n\r\n> We're living the future so\r\n> the present is our past.\r\n\r\nInline code\r\n\r\nI think you should use an\r\n`<addr>` element here instead.\r\n\r\nGitHub Flavored Markdown\r\n\r\nGitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.\r\n\r\nNote that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.\r\nSyntax highlighting\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction fancyAlert(arg) {\r\n  if(arg) {\r\n    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also simply indent your code by four spaces:\r\n\r\n    function fancyAlert(arg) {\r\n      if(arg) {\r\n        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of Python code without syntax highlighting:\r\n\r\ndef foo():\r\n    if not bar:\r\n        return True\r\n\r\nTask Lists\r\n\r\n- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported\r\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\r\n- [x] this is a complete item\r\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\r\n\r\nIf you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list. It also works in Pull Requests!\r\nTables\r\n\r\nYou can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:\r\n\r\nFirst Header | Second Header\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nContent from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\r\nContent in the first column | Content in the second column\r\n\r\nWould become:\r\nFirst Header \tSecond Header\r\nContent from cell 1 \tContent from cell 2\r\nContent in the first column \tContent in the second column\r\nSHA references\r\n\r\nAny reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.\r\n\r\n16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac\r\nmojombo@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac\r\nmojombo/github-flavored-markdown@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac\r\n\r\nIssue references within a repository\r\n\r\nAny number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.\r\n\r\n#1\r\nmojombo#1\r\nmojombo/github-flavored-markdown#1\r\n\r\nUsername @mentions\r\n\r\nTyping an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.\r\nAutomatic linking for URLs\r\n\r\nAny URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.\r\nStrikethrough\r\n\r\nAny word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
