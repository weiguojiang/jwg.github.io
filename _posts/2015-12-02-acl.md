title:  ACL usage in tele cloud

description:  check whether ACL can be used for load balancing
---

## ** introduction **
in the paper how GOOGLE implement their B4 network, it mentioned that they used ACL together with openflow,
[google B4](http://www.sdnap.com/sdn-technology/3665.html)

so we need analyze how they use it or how we can use it.

In this sprint, i will spend one day to check it.
First i will check the ACL feature in linux, cisco, mcRNC and LY ToR switch.

## ** mcRNC **

[pddb](http://pddb.inside.nsn.com/pddb/parameters/index.jsp)

in mcRNC, the action can be "accept", "drop", "dscp-mark", or "pip-mark".

 * accept: accepts all packets of the flow.
 * drop: drops all packets of the flow.
 * dscp-mark: modifies the DSCP sub-field of all IP packet headers of the flow.
 * pip-mark: marks all packets of the flow with given packet internal priority.

## ** Cisco part **
[cisco](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html)

it filter IP packets based on:  

* Source address
* Destination address
* Type of packet
* Any combination of these items

The syntax for an access list entry is:  

    access-list <number 100-199> <permit | deny> <protocol> <source> < source- mask> <operator source port> < destination> <destination-mask> < operator destination port> <options> < log>

The mask is different from the subnet masks a bit 0 means "exact match" and 1 means "don't care"

Examples:

     	access-list 111 permit tcp any host 152.8.1.1 eq 80
     	Permit tcp traffic coming from any source address destined to port 80 of host 152.8.1.1
     	access-list 123 deny any 178.22.8.9 0.0.255.255
     	Deny traffic from any source address destined to the network 178.22.0.0/16 regardless of the protocol

## ** Linux ACL **
i get the following links and will read it.

 * [iptable 中文解释](https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/cn/iptables-tutorial-cn-1.1.19.html)
 * [IP table compare with cisco ACL](http://www.utdallas.edu/~kxs028100/netsec/Lectures2/Firewall-Lab-Supplement.html)
 * [configuration for iptable](http://www.slideshare.net/stom123/iptables-14068296)
 * [firwall with ip table](http://www.afcea.org/events/asiapacific/13/documents/04IPTables-vs2.pdf)

3 tables used

* filter table (default table for firewalls)
  + used for packet filtering access lists
  + used to control forwarding packets between network
interfaces
* nat table
  + used for network address translation (destination NAT aka
DNAT source NAT aka SNAT, and masquerading)
* mangle table
  + used for modifying packet header fields
  + enables modifying Type of Service and Time To Live fields
of packet header
  + enables marking packets for later recognition
  + not usually required for firewall designs

[IPTables packet traverse map](http://www.adminsehow.com/2011/09/iptables-packet-traverse-map/#more-534)

* [ubuntu IPtable command syntax](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man8/iptables.8.html)
From this command, it seems it support packet offset match. we need check further whether it support copy it to header or meta data.

## ** ToR part **
it need do after ToR is available.

here is the command from Quanta Mesh switch guide:  
show Commands

    show mac access-lists <name>
    show mac access-lists
    show ip access-lists
    show access-lists { interface <slot/port> | port-channel <portchannel-id> } {in | out} | control-plane

Configuration Commands

    mac access-list extended <name>
    no mac access-list extended <name>
    no access-list {<1-99> | <100-199>} [<rule-id>]

    access-list (<1-99> deny | permit every | <srcip> <srcm ask>) | ( <100-199> deny | permit every | eigrp| gre | icmp | igmp | ip | ipinip | ospf | pim | tcp | udp | <number> srcip srcmask | any | host srcip [range portkey|startport portkey|endport | eq | neq | lt | gt portkey|0-65535 dstip dstmask | any | host dstip [range portkey|startport portkey|endport | eq | neq | lt | gt portkey|0-65535] [flag [+fin | -fin] [+syn | -syn] [+rst | -rst] [+psh | -psh] [+ack | -ack] [+urg | -urg] [established]] [fragments] [precedence <precedence>] | [tos <tos> <tosmask>] | [dscp <dscp>] [log] [time-range time-range-name] [assign-queue <queue-id>] [mirror | redirect <slot/port> | port-channel <portchannel-id>] [redirectExtAgent <agent-id>] [rate-limit rate burst-size] [<rule-id>])


how to interpret it:

    Assign Queue: The queue identifier to which packets matching this rule are assigned.
    Mirror Interface: The slot/port to which packets matching this rule are copied.
    Redirect Interface: This field displays the slot/port to which packets matching this rule are forwarded.      

Note:  

 * it doesn't support packet offset byte match
 * it doesn't support port mask match
 * it can support redirect for matched packet.

conclusion:

 * it can't be used for GTPU filter directly.
