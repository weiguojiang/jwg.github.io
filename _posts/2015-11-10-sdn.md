description:  UDP/GTP/SCTP based forwarding for load balancing
---

## ** introduction **
In telecommunication area, UDP/IP based transportation protocol is extensively used for call differentiation in many interfaces, like Iub, Iur, Iu-CS, Nb, etc.

* for RTP/UDP leg, the traffic path is {(BTS IP + udp port), (RNC IP + udp port)}
* for GTPU leg, the traffic path is {(GSN IP + GTP TEID),(RNC IP + TEID)}

SDN network need forward the traffic to the VM based on the above information. and IP stack need move to function VM

## ** Product consideration **

here are some parts we need consider before product can use.

 * Feature limitations (multiplex small packets, DMPG switch…)
 * IP fragement
 * IPsec
 * AVS: can it support support GTP later?
 * OVS, what's the performance (OVS+DPDK patch)

 * whether AVS support vlxan overlay ?
 * whether ovs support IP de/fragment ?
 * check legacy feature support about transport level
 * check legacy network service mapping with  SDN network  


 * How to assure ECMP can distrubute GTPU traffic to some Tor and OVS ?
   else OVS will be bottleneck ?
    * can Quantan switch support GTPU parse in ACL forwarding?

## **UDP port ID based forwarding**



* Suppose: Openflow based SDN switch can support UDP port ID+mask based forwarding(OVS is ok, physical SDN switch needs to be verified)
  - Can be applied both in physical and virtual SDN switch which support openflow
* UDP packet forwarding is based on pre-defined mapping rules:
  - the value of pre-defined subset inside source UDP port ID is used for forwarding
  - source UDP port ID is spilt into two parts: index to destination unit part; call differentiation part
* Using 4-Tuple(source IP address + source UDP port ID + destination IP address + destination UDP port ID) to identify a call/branch
  - Call/branch differentiation will not be a bottleneck: even only one public IP address is used for whole VNF




  ## **GTP TEID based forwarding**



  * Option 1:
    - Add GTP packet parsing function in
      + OVS/AVS is SW based, it’s possible
      + physical SDN switch, if it’s HW based or proprietary SW based, maybe not easy to support

  * Option 2
    - Copy the GTP tunnel ID information to s-UDP port ID
      + In current 29.060 specification, there is no definition about how to fill s-UDP
    - Physical/virtual SDN switch can forward the GTP packet just based on the info in the s-udp port ID where has the destination info

  ## **Load balancing taskforce**


  Start from Dec-2015, by SW3 ATOP team:
  * For physical/virtual SDN switch:
    - Verify UDP/SCTP port ID+mask based forwarding function
    - verify overlay between two OVS.
  * For GTP traffic:
    - Verify the feasibility to copy TEID info into s-udp port
		+ flow entry is based on the src port mask and dst port.
    - Adding GTP parsing function into virtual OVS/AVS or physical SDN switch
		+ discuss with vendor is it possible to add GTPU support in TOR switch
		  and is it possible to export one interface to let others design
  * bare HW switch
    - bare HW switch run pic8 os or big switch os ?
  * LB SW architecture (under the umbrella of NAAS):
    - Option 1: SDN APP over restconf with SDN controller
    - Option 2: SDN APP over CLI to SDN switches
  * VNF adaption for SDN based LB solution
  * LB integration with DC network
    - Located only in TOR switch
    - Located only in OVS/AVS
    - Located both in TOR and OVS/AVS
    - Role of Edge router?
    - VNF specific SDN switches or VNF specific LB VMs
