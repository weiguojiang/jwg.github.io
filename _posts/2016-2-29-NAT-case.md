## introduction
In openstack, it use NAT for guest to access the external network.
but in Tele network, some protocol can't be used via NAT, e.g. SCTP.
here it discribe what is NAT.

## Term

Network Address Translation

 * Inside local address (IL)
 * Inside global address (IG)
 * Outside local address (OL)
 * Outside global address (OG)

packet path:  
   `packet [IL, OL ]  <--> {NAT}  <--> Packet [IG, OG]`

### NAPT

   `packet [IL, OL , Port1]  <--> {NAT}  <--> Packet [IG, OG, Port2]`

## Tech issue

NAT need handle the packet IP and TCP header.
some protocol payload is relationship with the IP header. NAT need handle it.

Here list some feature:  

 * header Checksum
   - checksum for IP and TCP header need re-calculate.
 * fragment
   - it need handle packet re-order scenario.
      + first packet arrive first, then save the state to handle next.
      + later packet arrive first, save packet and wait the first packet.
 * IP sec
 * specific protocol
    - support following TCP/UDP protocol which has no IP in payload
      + (HTTP,TFTP,Telnet,NTP,NFS)
    - support following protocol which has IP addr in payload
      + ICMP, ftp
    - not support
       + BOOTP,SNMP
