## ** introduction **
here i will cover some case and configuration.
it is simple just for test specific feature, not for real use.
for example, it only create one IBGP connection.

## ** difference for EBGP and IBGP   **
EBGP

  * peers belong to different AS.
  * should be directly connect to each other.
  * Routing information can be propagated to other peers.

IBGP

* peers belong to the same AS.
* need a logically full meshed connection (why ?)
* Routing information never propagated to other peers.

---
EBGP use interface addr to create neighbor and IBGP use loopback addr to create neighor.

      interface Loopback0
      ip address 11.11.11.11 255.255.255.255

      router bgp 100
      no synchronization
      no auto-summary
      neighbor 1.1.1.2 remote-as 200

---
      interface Loopback0
      ip address 22.22.22.22 255.255.255.255

      router bgp 200
      no synchronization
      no auto-summary
      neighbor 1.1.1.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 44.44.44.44 remote-as 200
      neighbor 44.44.44.44 update-source loopback 0
      neighbor 44.44.44.44 next-hop-self

Q1: what's the usage for **"neighbor 44.44.44.44 next-hop-self"**   
A:  to update the nexthop.  

## ** BGP message  **
 * OPEN: " hello , let's make friends"
 * KeepAlive: i am alive, don't leave me alone
 * update: fresh news...
 * Notification: I won't play with you anymore

## ** case 1  **

### ** env description **

<img src="/images/other/bgp-case.png" alt="sdn" width="1000"></a>

here i create AS 100, AS 200, AS 300, AS 600 and AS 700.   
in AS 200, there are R2,R3 R4 routes, each runs ospf.  
R2 and R4 is ibgp neighbor.   
all the router has create one IPaddr on loopback interface and will be the root id.   

### ** shutdown the link between R4 and R5 **
Lets check the R4 state.  

      R4#show ip route bgp
           1.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
      B       1.1.1.0 [200/0] via 22.22.22.22, 00:19:46
           5.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
      B       5.5.5.0 [200/0] via 22.22.22.22, 00:19:46
           6.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
      B       6.6.6.0 [200/0] via 22.22.22.22, 00:19:46
           10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
      B       10.0.0.0 [200/0] via 22.22.22.22, 00:19:46
      R4#show ip bgp
      BGP table version is 5, local router ID is 44.44.44.44
      Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal,
                    r RIB-failure, S Stale
      Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete

         Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
      *>i1.1.1.0/24       22.22.22.22              0    100      0 100 i
      *>i5.5.5.0/24       22.22.22.22              0    100      0 100 700 600 i
      *>i6.6.6.0/24       22.22.22.22              0    100      0 100 700 i
      *>i10.0.0.0/24      22.22.22.22              0    100      0 100 i

Q2:if delete the following command and see what will happens ?  
    ~~neighbor 44.44.44.44 next-hop-self~~   
result:    
with this command, R4 can get the routing information from the R2 with the NEXT_HOP is R2's IP. else the NEXT_HOP is R1's IP without this command.  

Q3: what's about IGP and IBGP synchronization ?   
in this example, R5 send one packet to R4 with description is R1. R4 know it can reach there via R2. so it forward the packet to R3 but R3 don't know how to reach the R1. so it drop the packet. that's the IP route hole.  
if "synchronization" is on, then Router need make sure that the route is known by IGP before it inject the one which is learned from IBGP to route table. but there is one risk if synchronization is one,
 that if the router can learn the route in full mesh network, it will not work.


ANY solution:

* redistribute bgp into ospf, is it good? what's the risk?

Q4: How to do while so many routers in one AS ?

 * full mesh for ibgp. what's the risk
 * use reflector (what doesn it mean?)
 * use confederation. (what doesn it mean?)

### ** no shutdown the link between R4 and R5 **
Lets check the R4 state again

      R4#show ip route bgp
           1.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
      B       1.1.1.0 [200/0] via 22.22.22.22, 00:39:00

      B       5.5.5.0 [20/0] via 4.4.4.5, 00:04:32
           6.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
      B       6.6.6.0 [200/0] via 22.22.22.22, 00:39:00

## ** protocol study  **
Q3: Why bgp can avoid routing loop ?   
N: in bgp packet, it has several attributes of the path. "ORIGIN, NEXT_HOP, AS_PATH."

Q4: How ibgp avoid routing loop ?   
N: by hori seperate. ibgp can't pass the information to ibgp neighor again.

Q5: how bgp select the route ?   
N: you can compare "ip bgp" with "ip route bgp". user can adjust the route based on

  * Weight
  * local-pref
  * MED
  * AS-PATH

Q6: Do you know the following terminology

 * Autonomous systems, including stud autonomous systems and transit autonomous systems
 * BGP peers
 * Internal BGP
 * External BGP
 * Routing protocols
 * When to use and when not to use BGP
 * Ingress filtering
 * BGP update messages

### ** route reflector   **

in the above example, we make R3 as the RR(Rourte reflector)
R4 as the client and R3 and R4 is the cluster.
R2 and R3 form non-client ibgp neighor and R3 and R4 form bigp neighor,

Rule:  

* learn route from IBGP non-client neighor, reflecr it to client.
* learn route from client, reflect it to non-client and client
* learn route from EBGP, relrect it to all non-client and client neighor.

here is R3's configuration:

      router bgp 200
      no synchronization
      no auto-summary
      neighbor 44.44.44.44 remote-as 200
      neighbor 44.44.44.44 update-source loopback 0
      neighbor 44.44.44.44 route-reflector-client
      neighbor 22.22.22.22 remote-as 200
      neighbor 22.22.22.22 update-source loopback 0
